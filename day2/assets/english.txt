A private conversation

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting.
I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.
They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round.
I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention.
In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. I can't hear a word! I said angrily.
It's none of your business,  the young man said rudely. This is a private conversation!

Breakfast or lunch?

It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime.
Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. ‘
What a day!’ I thought. ‘It's raining again. ’ Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy.
‘I've just arrived by train, ’ she said. ‘I'm coming to see you. ’
‘But I'm still having breakfast, ’ I said.
‘What are you doing?’ she asked.
‘I'm having breakfast, ’ I repeated.
‘Dear me, ’ she said. ‘Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!’
